# LANDRS_PySOSA

A python module for building SOSA  based RDF graphs

LANDRS (Linked And Networked DRoneS) project amongst other things weâ€™re working
on creating an ontology and building an OpenAPI specification for creating a Restful API
for building linked data native drone data applications. LANDRS is a Sloan Foundation
funded project to build open source APIs for managing scientific data on drones through the
use of web standards and linked data technologies.

The project endeavors to implement PySOSA: A python module for building SOSA  based RDF graphs.
Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontology, provides a lightweight core for Semantic Sensor Network (SSN).
SOSA aims at broadening the target audience and application areas that can make use of Semantic Web ontologies.
To find out more about SOSA and SSN check out http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/ and http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/

# Getting started
PySOSA is A python module for building RDF graphs using the W3C SOSA (Sensors, Observations, Samples,
and Actuators) ontology. For more see https://github.com/landrs-toolkit/PySOSA. In short pySOSA implements
a python-based Linked-Data API for Networked Drones.
